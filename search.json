Emissions activity tends occur local time e.g. rush hour 8 every day. clocks go forward spring, emissions effectively released atmosphere typically 1 hour earlier summertime .e. DST applies. plotting diurnal profiles, effect “smearing-” concentrations. Sometimes, useful approach express time local time. correction tends produce better-defined diurnal profiles concentration (variables) allows better comparison made emissions/activity data. set FALSE GMT used.

Can “mean” (default), “median”, “max” (maximum), “frequency”. “stdev” (standard deviation), “weighted.mean” “cpf” (Conditional Probability Function). smoothing involved, colour scale statistics provide indication overall pattern interpreted concentration units e.g. statistic = \"weighted.mean\" bin mean multiplied bin frequency divided total frequency. many cases using polarFreq better. Setting statistic = \"weighted.mean\" can useful provides indication concentration * frequency occurrence highlight wind speed/direction conditions dominate overall mean. percentile statistic = \"percentile\" statistic = \"cpf\" percentile used, expressed 0 100. Note percentile value calculated wind speed, wind direction ‘bins’. reason can also useful set min.bin ensure sufficient number points available estimate percentile. See quantile details percentiles calculated. width width annulus; can “normal” (default), “thin” “fat”. min.bin minimum number points allowed wind speed/wind direction bin.  default 1. value two requires least 2 valid records bin ; bins less 2 valid records set NA. Care taken using value > 1 risk removing real data points. recommended consider data care. Also, polarFreq function can use circumstances. exclude.missing Setting option TRUE (default) removes points plot far original data. smoothing routines produce predictions points data exist .e. predict. removing points far original data produces plot clear original data lie. set FALSE missing data interpolated. date.pad type = \"trend\" (default), date.pad = TRUE pad-missing data beginning first year end last year. purpose ensure trend plot begins ends beginning end year. force.positive default TRUE. Sometimes smoothing data steep gradients possible predicted values negative. force.positive = TRUE ensures predictions remain positive. useful several reasons. First, lots missing data interpolation needed can result artefacts predictions far original data. Second, known beforehand data positive, option carries assumption prediction. likely time setting force.positive = FALSE background concentrations first subtracted resulting data legitimately negative. vast majority situations expected user need alter default option. k smoothing value supplied gam temporal wind direction components, respectively. cases e.g. trend plot less 1-year data smoothing default values may become noisy affected outliers. Choosing lower value k (say 10) may help produce better plot. normalise TRUE concentrations normalised dividing mean value. done fitting smooth surface. option particularly useful one interested patterns concentrations several pollutants different scales e.g. NOx CO.

Arguments passed openair::polarPlot wd Name wind direction field. statistic statistic applied wind speed/direction bin. smoothing involved, colour scale statistics provide indication overall pattern interpreted concentration units e.g. statistic = \"weighted.mean\" bin mean multiplied bin frequency divided total frequency. many cases using polarFreq better. Setting statistic = \"weighted.mean\" can useful provides indication concentration * frequency occurrence highlight wind speed/direction conditions dominate overall mean.Can : “mean” (default), “median”, “max” (maximum), “frequency”. “stdev” (standard deviation), “weighted.mean”. statistic = \"nwr\" Implements Non-parametric Wind Regression approach Henry et al. (2009) uses kernel smoothers. openair implementation identical Gaussian kernels used wind direction speed. smoothing controlled ws_spread wd_spread. statistic = \"cpf\" conditional probability function (CPF) plotted single (usually high) percentile level supplied. CPF defined CPF = /ny, number samples y bin (default wind direction, wind speed interval) mixing ratios greater overall percentile concentration, ny total number samples wind sector (see Ashbaugh et al., 1985). Note percentile intervals can also considered; see percentile details. statistic = \"r\" statistic = \"Pearson\", Pearson correlation coefficient calculated two pollutants. calculation involves weighted Pearson correlation coefficient, weighted Gaussian kernels wind direction radial variable (default wind speed). weight assigned values close wind speed-direction interval. Kernel weighting used ensure data used rather relying potentially small number values wind speed-direction interval. statistic = \"Spearman\", Spearman correlation coefficient calculated two pollutants. calculation involves weighted Spearman correlation coefficient, weighted Gaussian kernels wind direction radial variable (default wind speed). weight assigned values close wind speed-direction interval. Kernel weighting used ensure data used rather relying potentially small number values wind speed-direction interval. \"robust_slope\" another option pair-wise statistics \"quantile.slope\", uses quantile regression estimate slope particular quantile level (see also tau setting quantile level). \"york_slope\" another option pair-wise statistics uses York regression method estimate slope. method uncertainties x y used determination slope. uncertainties provided x_error y_error — see . exclude.missing Setting option TRUE (default) removes points plot far original data. smoothing routines produce predictions points data exist .e. predict. removing points far original data produces plot clear original data lie. set FALSE missing data interpolated. uncertainty uncertainty calculated surface shown? TRUE three plots produced scale showing predicted surface together estimated lower upper uncertainties 95% confidence interval. Calculating uncertainties useful understand whether features real .  example, high wind speeds data greater uncertainty predicted values. uncertainties calculated using GAM weighting done frequency measurements wind speed-direction bin. Note uncertainties calculated type set \"default\". percentile statistic = \"percentile\" percentile used, expressed 0 100. Note percentile value calculated wind speed, wind direction ‘bins’. reason can also useful set min.bin ensure sufficient number points available estimate percentile. See quantile details percentiles calculated. percentile also used Conditional Probability Function (CPF) plots. percentile can length two, case percentile interval considered use CPF. example, percentile = c(90, 100) plot CPF concentrations 90 100th percentiles. Percentile intervals can useful identifying specific sources. addition, percentile can also length 3. third value ‘trim’ value applied. calculating percentile intervals many can cover low values useful information. trim value ensures values greater equal trim * mean value considered percentile intervals calculated. effect extract detail many source signatures. See manual examples. Finally, trim value less zero percentile range interpreted absolute concentration values subsetting carried directly. weights edges plot may data points wind speed-direction interval, situations distort plot concentrations high. weights applies weighting reduce influence. example default single data point exists weighting factor 0.25 two points 0.5. apply weighting use data , use weights = c(1, 1, 1). alternative -weighting points can removed altogether using min.bin. min.bin minimum number points allowed wind speed/wind direction bin.  default 1. value two requires least 2 valid records bin ; bins less 2 valid records set NA. Care taken using value > 1 risk removing real data points. recommended consider data care. Also, polarFreq function can use circumstances. mis.col min.bin > 1 can useful show data removed plots. done shading missing data mis.col. highlight missing data min.bin > 1 choose mis.col = \"transparent\". upper sets upper limit wind speed used. Often relatively data points high wind speeds plotting can reduce useful information plot. force.positive default TRUE. Sometimes smoothing data steep gradients possible predicted values negative. force.positive = TRUE ensures predictions remain positive. useful several reasons. First, lots missing data interpolation needed can result artefacts predictions far original data. Second, known beforehand data positive, option carries assumption prediction. likely time setting force.positive = FALSE background concentrations first subtracted resulting data legitimately negative. vast majority situations expected user need alter default option. k smoothing parameter used gam function package mgcv. Typically, value around 100 (default) seems suitable resolve important features plot. appropriate choice k problem-dependent; extensive testing polar plots many different problems suggests value k 100 suitable. Setting k higher values tend affect surface predictions much add computation time. Lower values k increase smoothing. Sometimes data plot polarPlot fail. circumstances can worth lowering value k. normalise TRUE concentrations normalised dividing mean value. done fitting smooth surface. option particularly useful one interested patterns concentrations several pollutants different scales e.g. NOx CO. Often useful one pollutant chosen. auto.text Either TRUE (default) FALSE.

Arguments passed openair::polarPlot wd Name wind direction field. statistic statistic applied wind speed/direction bin. smoothing involved, colour scale statistics provide indication overall pattern interpreted concentration units e.g. statistic = \"weighted.mean\" bin mean multiplied bin frequency divided total frequency. many cases using polarFreq better. Setting statistic = \"weighted.mean\" can useful provides indication concentration * frequency occurrence highlight wind speed/direction conditions dominate overall mean.Can : “mean” (default), “median”, “max” (maximum), “frequency”. “stdev” (standard deviation), “weighted.mean”. statistic = \"nwr\" Implements Non-parametric Wind Regression approach Henry et al. (2009) uses kernel smoothers. openair implementation identical Gaussian kernels used wind direction speed. smoothing controlled ws_spread wd_spread. statistic = \"cpf\" conditional probability function (CPF) plotted single (usually high) percentile level supplied. CPF defined CPF = /ny, number samples y bin (default wind direction, wind speed interval) mixing ratios greater overall percentile concentration, ny total number samples wind sector (see Ashbaugh et al., 1985). Note percentile intervals can also considered; see percentile details. statistic = \"r\" statistic = \"Pearson\", Pearson correlation coefficient calculated two pollutants. calculation involves weighted Pearson correlation coefficient, weighted Gaussian kernels wind direction radial variable (default wind speed). weight assigned values close wind speed-direction interval. Kernel weighting used ensure data used rather relying potentially small number values wind speed-direction interval. statistic = \"Spearman\", Spearman correlation coefficient calculated two pollutants. calculation involves weighted Spearman correlation coefficient, weighted Gaussian kernels wind direction radial variable (default wind speed). weight assigned values close wind speed-direction interval. Kernel weighting used ensure data used rather relying potentially small number values wind speed-direction interval. \"robust_slope\" another option pair-wise statistics \"quantile.slope\", uses quantile regression estimate slope particular quantile level (see also tau setting quantile level). \"york_slope\" another option pair-wise statistics uses York regression method estimate slope. method uncertainties x y used determination slope. uncertainties provided x_error y_error — see . exclude.missing Setting option TRUE (default) removes points plot far original data. smoothing routines produce predictions points data exist .e. predict. removing points far original data produces plot clear original data lie. set FALSE missing data interpolated. uncertainty uncertainty calculated surface shown? TRUE three plots produced scale showing predicted surface together estimated lower upper uncertainties 95% confidence interval. Calculating uncertainties useful understand whether features real .  example, high wind speeds data greater uncertainty predicted values. uncertainties calculated using GAM weighting done frequency measurements wind speed-direction bin. Note uncertainties calculated type set \"default\". percentile statistic = \"percentile\" percentile used, expressed 0 100. Note percentile value calculated wind speed, wind direction ‘bins’. reason can also useful set min.bin ensure sufficient number points available estimate percentile. See quantile details percentiles calculated. percentile also used Conditional Probability Function (CPF) plots. percentile can length two, case percentile interval considered use CPF. example, percentile = c(90, 100) plot CPF concentrations 90 100th percentiles. Percentile intervals can useful identifying specific sources. addition, percentile can also length 3. third value ‘trim’ value applied. calculating percentile intervals many can cover low values useful information. trim value ensures values greater equal trim * mean value considered percentile intervals calculated. effect extract detail many source signatures. See manual examples. Finally, trim value less zero percentile range interpreted absolute concentration values subsetting carried directly. weights edges plot may data points wind speed-direction interval, situations distort plot concentrations high. weights applies weighting reduce influence. example default single data point exists weighting factor 0.25 two points 0.5. apply weighting use data , use weights = c(1, 1, 1). alternative -weighting points can removed altogether using min.bin. min.bin minimum number points allowed wind speed/wind direction bin.  default 1. value two requires least 2 valid records bin ; bins less 2 valid records set NA. Care taken using value > 1 risk removing real data points. recommended consider data care. Also, polarFreq function can use circumstances. mis.col min.bin > 1 can useful show data removed plots. done shading missing data mis.col. highlight missing data min.bin > 1 choose mis.col = \"transparent\". angle.scale Sometimes placement scale may interfere interesting feature. user can therefore set angle.scale value 0 360 degrees mitigate problems. example angle.scale = 45 draw scale heading NE direction. units units shown polar axis scale. force.positive default TRUE. Sometimes smoothing data steep gradients possible predicted values negative. force.positive = TRUE ensures predictions remain positive. useful several reasons. First, lots missing data interpolation needed can result artefacts predictions far original data. Second, known beforehand data positive, option carries assumption prediction. likely time setting force.positive = FALSE background concentrations first subtracted resulting data legitimately negative. vast majority situations expected user need alter default option. k smoothing parameter used gam function package mgcv. Typically, value around 100 (default) seems suitable resolve important features plot. appropriate choice k problem-dependent; extensive testing polar plots many different problems suggests value k 100 suitable. Setting k higher values tend affect surface predictions much add computation time. Lower values k increase smoothing. Sometimes data plot polarPlot fail. circumstances can worth lowering value k. normalise TRUE concentrations normalised dividing mean value. done fitting smooth surface. option particularly useful one interested patterns concentrations several pollutants different scales e.g. NOx CO. Often useful one pollutant chosen. key.header Adds additional text/labels scale key. example, passing options key.header = \"header\", key.footer = \"footer1\" adds addition text scale key. arguments passed drawOpenKey via quickText, applying auto.text argument, handle formatting. key.footer see key.footer. key.position Location scale key plotted.
